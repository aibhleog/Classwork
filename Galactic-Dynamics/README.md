## This folder contains the work for my Galactic Dynamics final class project.
These are all of the scripts and resulting figures created and used in my final project. They are described below:

### Contents -- Scripts
+ **lensdemo_funcs.py** -- these are the three functions created by Adam Bolton (Senior Scientist, NOAO) in 2009; import as module for following scripts.
+ **see_deflection.py** -- visualizes the deflection gradient of the SIE lens given a lens strength and axis ratio.
+ **lens-bkgd.py** -- given parameters for a background source, this script lenses the source plane and shows the source plane and image plane side-by-side.
+ **lens-bkgd-2rax.py** -- similar to the previous script, this lenses the source plane and shows the source plane and image plane side-by-side, but with two image planes (one with axis ratio of 1.; the other, 2.).
+ **lens_gif.py** -- animation of a lensing event where the SIE point-like lens is moving across the field of view.
+ **fig#.py** -- scripts used to create the first two figures of my paper report; useful for discussions about gravitational lensing.

#### Contents -- Figures & GIFs
+ **lens-still##** -- these are the output from the `lens-bkgd.py` script.
+ **lens2-still##** -- these are the output from the `lens-bkgd-2rax.py` script.
+ **source##** -- these are the output from the `lens_gif.py` script.
+ **deflection.pdf** -- the output from the `see_deflection.py` script.
+ **fig##** -- useful figures for discussing gravitational lensing.

Have fun playing with the scripts -- happy lensing!
##### NOTE: the scripts assume your default `python` is `python 3.6.0`
